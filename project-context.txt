## Main Models

- models/author.js: Defines Author schema with a `name` field. Exports the Mongoose model.
- models/book.js: Defines Book schema (fields depend on your app). Exports the Mongoose model.

---

## Main Routes

- routes/index.js: Handles `/`, renders `views/index.ejs`.
- routes/authors.js: Handles `/authors` routes:
  - GET /authors: List/search authors, renders `authors/index.ejs`.
  - GET /authors/new: Show form to create a new author, renders `authors/new.ejs`.
  - POST /authors: Create a new author, saves to MongoDB, redirects or shows error.
- routes/books.js: Handles `/books` routes (similar structure to authors).

---

## Views and Layouts

- All views are rendered inside `views/layouts/layout.ejs` using EJS layouts.
- Layout includes header and error message partials.
- The main content is injected via `<%- body %>`.

---

## Workflow

1. App starts with `server.js`:
   - Loads environment variables.
   - Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
   - Sets up EJS as the view engine and uses `express-ejs-layouts`.
   - Registers routes from `routes/index.js`, `routes/authors.js`, and `routes/books.js`.

2. User visits `/`:
   - `routes/index.js` renders the home page.

3. User visits `/authors`:
   - `routes/authors.js` fetches authors from MongoDB and renders the list/search page.

4. User creates a new author:
   - Form in `authors/new.ejs` posts to `/authors`.
   - Route creates a new Author document and saves it.
   - On success, redirects to `/authors`; on error, re-renders form with error message.

5. Views are rendered inside the main layout:
   - Header and error messages are included as partials.
   - The layout provides consistent structure for all pages.

---

## Variables and Data Flow

- Author model: Used in `authors.js` for CRUD operations.
- Book model: Used in `books.js` for CRUD operations.
- searchOptions: Used to filter authors in the list/search route.
- errorMessage: Passed to views to display errors (rendered via `errorMessage.ejs`).

---

## Summary

Your app is a basic Express/Mongoose CRUD application for managing authors and books, using EJS for templating and layouts.
Routes are modular, models are separated, and views are organized for maintainability.
